**When to use:** When starting a new project or revisiting the overall product vision.
**When not to use:** When implementation has already started — use “Architecture Planning” instead.

Let’s generate the **Project Overview Document** using the Project Overview Loop Template.
Ask clarifying questions about the **core purpose**, **target audience**, and **high-level phases** before drafting.
Use the provided structure (Project Purpose & Summary, Core Goals, etc.).
Ask for confirmation first that all of the high-level scope questions have been asked and answered before actually writing the Project Overview.
When you finally get confirmation to write the document, write the result to `/docs/foundation/project_overview.md`.

**Project Overview Loop Template reference:** `/prompts/system/foundation/01_project_overview_loop.md`.

Get the initial basic description of the project from `/docs/requirements/requirements.md`.

Reference `/docs/requirements/evaluation_criteria.md` for an idea about the general way in which all Gauntlet projects are evaluated.
